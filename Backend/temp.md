{"review":"`` json\n{\n \"review\": \"Hi, thanks for submitting this code! I have a few comments.\\n\\n*
**Correctness:** The function `sum()` attempts to return the sum of `a` and `b`, but `a` and `b` are not defined within
the function's scope. This will lead to a `ReferenceError` when the function is called if `a` and `b` aren't defined in
the surrounding scope. Even if they *are* in the surrounding scope, relying on global variables makes the function's
behavior unpredictable and hard to reason about.\\n\\n* **Readability/Maintainability:** It's unclear what `a` and `b`
represent without any context. Good function design includes explicitly defining inputs as parameters, so a reader knows
what to expect and the function can work with any values, not just those in the global
scope.\\n\\n**Suggestion:**\\n\\nTo address these issues, I suggest modifying the function to accept `a` and `b` as
parameters. This makes the function self-contained, predictable, and reusable.\\n\\n ``javascript\\nfunction sum(a, b)
{\\n return a + b;\\n}\\n\\n// Example usage:\\nlet result = sum(5, 3); // result will be
8\\nconsole.log(result);\\n`` \\n\\nThis revised version:\\n\\n* Clearly defines the inputs `a` and `b` as
parameters.\\n* Avoids reliance on global variables.\\n* Is more readable and maintainable because its behavior is
explicit.\\n\\nConsider adding JSDoc comments to further improve readability, especially if the function is part of a
larger library or API. For example:\\n\\n ``javascript\\n/\*_\\n _ Calculates the sum of two numbers.\\n _ @param
{number} a The first number.\\n _ @param {number} b The second number.\\n _ @returns {number} The sum of a and b.\\n
_/\\nfunction sum(a, b) {\\n return a + b;\\n}\\n`\\n\\nOverall, the initial function was very concise, but lacked
necessary context and could lead to errors and maintainability issues. Parameterizing the inputs and adding
documentation greatly improves it.\"\n}\n`"}
